                Of the 100-plus annual shark attacks worldwide, a 
                third to a half are attributed to great white sharks. 
                Most of these, however, are not fatal. Research finds that 
                great whites, which are naturally curious, often "sample bite" 
                then release their human target. It's not a terribly comforting 
                distinction, but it does indicate that humans are not actually on 
                the great white's menu. Fatal attacks, experts say, are typically
                cases of mistaken identity: Swimmers and surfers can look a 
                lot like their favorite prey—seals—when seen from below.
